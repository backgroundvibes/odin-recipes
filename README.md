# odin-recipes

This is my take on the Recipes project from the online web development course, The Odin Project. I'll be making a website that, as far as i understand, will be a couple of pages that provide various recipes. while I will not be the original creator of most of the content, this will demonstrate my ability to create functional websites from scratch.
