    <p>
        This creamy tuna pasta bake is a store cupboard saviour. Pasta, sweetcorn, 
        tuna fish - all make up the bulk of the meal. Frozen peas are a great addition 
        too - but you can use canned or fresh if you like. Apart from that, we're 
        really just talking whipping cream, cheese and a bit of butter from the fridge.
