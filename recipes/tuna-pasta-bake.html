        Creamy Tuna Pasta Bake - tuna with pasta, peas and sweetcorn in a a lovely

    </p>
    <p>
        This creamy tuna pasta bake is a store cupboard saviour. Pasta, sweetcorn, 
        tuna fish - all make up the bulk of the meal. Frozen peas are a great addition 
        too - but you can use canned or fresh if you like. Apart from that, we're 
        really just talking whipping cream, cheese and a bit of butter from the fridge.

        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained and flaked</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook, 
        stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. 
        Drain and toss pasta with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an ovenproof baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
        While pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. 
        Add onion and cook, stirring often, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. 
        Add tuna and cook for 2 minutes. Pour heavy cream over tuna and season with salt, 
        pepper, and nutmeg. Add pasta and toss well. Transfer to the prepared baking 
        dish and cover with Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
