    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
     Kedgeree consists of curried rice, smoked fish, boiled eggs, parsley and lemon juice. 
     It may be considered a traditional British breakfast dish but its roots are well 
     bedded in Indian cooking having started its life as khichari, a humble dish of rice 
     and lentils. Thanks to the melting pot of food of British Raj and the colonization 
     of the sub-continent, the dish was taken, adapted (originally there was no fish) and 
     turned into something more familiar to those serving in India, and it returned to 
     these shores with them.

     <p>
        The British unable to simply leave a dish alone, added the 
     fish part to give the dish a protein element and as fish is a popular breakfast dish 
     (Kippers) suited the British palette. In the UK the fish used is smoked haddock, in 
     India this was not possible and any fish used would have been fresh and because of 
     the searing heat was eaten at breakfast as any later in the day most likely would 
     have gone off.

        <li>2 eggs</li>

        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Prepare rice according to package directions. Drain, and set aside to cool. 
        Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and 
        immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 
        12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
        Place the haddock in a small skillet with the bay leaf. Pour in enough milk just 
        to cover the fish. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, and cook gently until fish 
        flakes. Remove fish from the pan, flake with a fork, and set aside. Discard milk 
        and bay leaf.
        </li>
        <li>
        Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in curry powder, then add 
        the peas and onions. Fry for a couple of minutes, then add the cooked rice, eggs, 
        and fish. Stir gently, and season with salt and pepper. Heat through, and serve 
        with yogurt.
