    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
     Kedgeree consists of curried rice, smoked fish, boiled eggs, parsley and lemon juice. 
     It may be considered a traditional British breakfast dish but its roots are well 
     bedded in Indian cooking having started its life as khichari, a humble dish of rice 
     and lentils. Thanks to the melting pot of food of British Raj and the colonization 
     of the sub-continent, the dish was taken, adapted (originally there was no fish) and 
     turned into something more familiar to those serving in India, and it returned to 
     these shores with them. 
    </p>
     <p>
        The British unable to simply leave a dish alone, added the 
     fish part to give the dish a protein element and as fish is a popular breakfast dish 
     (Kippers) suited the British palette. In the UK the fish used is smoked haddock, in 
     India this was not possible and any fish used would have been fresh and because of 
     the searing heat was eaten at breakfast as any later in the day most likely would 
     have gone off.
