    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    Chicken Tikka Kebab is a delicious appetizer that is packed with flavor.
     It starts with chicken pieces marinated in yogurt along with lemon juice and
     aromatic spices, then threaded onto skewers and cooked to create a simple meal 
     that'll leave you wanting more. Make it in the air fryer or oven to serve at 
     the gathering, or include it into your meal prep for the week.
